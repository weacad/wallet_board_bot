# Solana Wallet Leaderboard

Bot created to monitor group's Solana trades and compare PnL for users. 

## How to use:
### 1) Clone repository

### 2) Update config.py
We used the Helius API instead of Solana blockchain, so you have to register for a Helius free plan in order to use. Also create a discord bot and get the bot secret token to put in config.py.

### 3) Invite bot to your discord server

### 4) Use commands to begin comparing PnL across users.
!leaderboard - shows leaderboard \
!set_wallet {wallet_id} - adds a wallet id for user running
